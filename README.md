```

## üé® Customization

### Colors and Theming
The game uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Modify the `:root` section in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-blue: #2563eb;
    --player1-color: #ef4444;  /* Red player */
    --player2-color: #f59e0b;  /* Yellow player */
    --board-bg: #1e293b;      /* Board background */
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Board Size
Adjust the board dimensions by modifying these CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --board-max-width: min(90vw, 500px);
    --board-gap: clamp(4px, 1.5vw, 8px);
}
```

### Game Logic
Core game logic is in `script.js`:
- `checkForWin()`: Win detection algorithm
- `placePiece()`: Piece placement and animation
- `handleColumnClick()`: Turn management and validation

## üåê Deployment

### Local Network
To play across devices on the same network:
1. Find your computer's IP address
2. Start the server: `npm start`
3. Access from other devices: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`

**Step-by-Step Deployment:**

1. **Prepare Your Repository**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Make sure `package.json` includes the start script:
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "start": "node server.js"
       }
     }
     ```

   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

4. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=10000 (Render automatically sets this)
   ```

#### Heroku
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
npm install -g heroku

# Login and create app
heroku login
heroku create your-connect-four-app

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

#### Railway
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub and select repository
3. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys
4. Automatic SSL and custom domains available

#### VPS/Cloud Server
```bash
# Clone on server
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/connect-four-pro.git
cd connect-four-pro
npm install

# Use PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name "connect-four"
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for configuration:
```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Server Configuration
Modify `server.js` for custom settings:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const io = new Server(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: "*",  // Configure for production
        methods: ["GET", "POST"]
    }
});
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill process on port 3000
   npx kill-port 3000
   # Or use different port
   PORT=3001 npm start
   ```

2. **Socket Connection Failed**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify server is running
   - Try different browser/incognito mode

3. **Mobile Touch Issues**
   - Ensure viewport meta tag is present
   - Check touch event handlers
   - Verify minimum touch target sizes

4. **Game State Sync Issues**
   - Refresh both devices
   - Check network connection
   - Verify Socket.IO events are firing
