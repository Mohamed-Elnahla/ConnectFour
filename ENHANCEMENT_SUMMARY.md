# Connect Four Multiplayer Enhancements - Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Connect Four online multiplayer game with three major features: player name collection, reaction system, and rematch functionality. All features have been fully implemented and tested.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Player Name Collection System
- **Frontend**: Added name input field in online lobby for player identification
- **Backend**: Enhanced `createGame` and `joinGame` socket events to handle player names
- **UI**: Player names are displayed properly in turn indicators and game end messages
- **Default**: Fallback to "Player 1" and "Player 2" if names not provided

### 2. Reaction System
- **Real-time Reactions**: Players can send reactions (👍, 👎, 😄, 😮, 🔥, 💪) during gameplay
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated reaction overlays show both sent and received reactions
- **Socket Events**: `sendReaction` and `reactionReceived` events for real-time communication
- **Responsive Design**: Reaction buttons adapt to different screen sizes

### 3. Enhanced Rematch System
- **Modal-based Interface**: Replaced browser alerts with custom modal for rematch requests
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Server uses Set instead of Array to prevent rematch request loops
- **Smart State Management**: Proper cleanup of rematch state between games
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback for waiting, accepting, and declining rematch requests

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
